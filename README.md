    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"

**NOTE: There can be some conflict between `yarn` and `npm` when cloning from certain repositories. It's best to assume that every repo may need trimming before ultimately running `npm` install. I tested the above steps several times under several different factors. This is the best I have so far.**
